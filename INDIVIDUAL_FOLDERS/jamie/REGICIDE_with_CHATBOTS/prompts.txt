I am going to play a game with you called regicide.  Here is the text rules of the game: 

Rules for Regicide
"
AIM OF THE GAME

Regicide is a cooperative game where players work 
together to defeat 12 powerful enemies. Players 
take turns to play cards to the table to attack the 
enemy and once enough damage is dealt, the 
enemy is defeated. The players win when the last 
King is defeated. But beware! Each turn the enemy 
strikes back. Players will discard cards to satisfy the 
damage and if they can’t discard enough, everyone 
loses!

SETUP

Shuffle the 4 Kings (K) and put them facedown in 
a pile on the table. Shuffle the 4 Queens (Q) and 
put them facedown on top of the Kings. Shuffle the 
4 Jacks (J) and put them facedown on top of the 
Queens. This is the Castle deck. 

Place the Castle deck in the centre of the table and 
turn the top card face up to reveal a Jack. This will 
become the current enemy. 

Shuffle together all the cards numbered 2 to 10 
with the 4 Animal Companions (A) and a number 
of Jesters (*) based on the number of players (see 
table below) to form your Tavern deck. 

The Tavern deck is where cards are dealt and drawn 
from. During the game place any discarded cards 
into a shared discard pile beside the Tavern deck.
Deal cards to each player up to their maximum hand 
size.

Players	 	Jesters Max. 	Hand Size 
1 			0 				8
2 			0 				7
3 			1 				6
4 			2 				5

The player to have most recently committed 
regicide goes first (or choose randomly)

HOW TO PLAY

On their turn a player will play cards from their 
hand to deal damage to the current enemy in order 
to defeat it. The values on the cards determine 
damage, while the suit provides a special power. 

Each turn has four steps:
Step 1 - Play a card or yield
Step 2 - Activate the suit power
Step 3 - Deal damage to the enemy and check
Step 4 - Suffer damage from the enemy

STEP ONE
Play a card from hand to attack the enemy
Play a card from your hand onto the table in front of 
you. The number of the card determines the attack 
value. So if a 7 of Hearts is played, the attack value is 
7. Instead of playing a card a player may choose to 
yield (see Yielding).

STEP TWO
Activate the played card’s suit power
Playing a card to damage the enemy also grants a 
power associated with the suit of that card. Powers 
from red suits are resolved straight away, powers 
from black suits take effect in later steps.

HEARTS
Heal from the discard: Shuffle the discard pile then 
count out a number of cards facedown equal to the 
attack value played. Place them under the Tavern 
deck (no peeking!) then, return the discard pile to 
the table, faceup.
DIAMONDS
Draw cards: The current player draws a card. The 
other players follow in clockwise order drawing one 
card at a time until a number of cards equal to the 
attack value played have been drawn. Players that 
have reached their maximum hand size are skipped. 
Players may never draw cards over their maximum 
hand size. There is no penalty for failing to draw 
cards from an empty Tavern deck
CLUBS
Double damage: During Step 3, damage dealt by 
clubs counts for double. E.g., The 8 of Clubs deals 16 
damage.
SPADES
Shield against enemy attack: During Step 4, reduce 
the attack value of the current enemy by the attack 
value played. The shield effects of spades are 
cumulative for all spades played against this enemy 
by any player, and remain in effect until the enemy 
is defeated.

Suit powers are mandatory and cannot be skipped.

STEP THREE
Deal damage and check to see if the enemy is 
defeated

Enemy 		Attack 	Health
Jack (J) 	10 		20
Queen (Q) 	15 		30
King (K) 	20 		40 

Damage equal to the attack value of the played 
card is now dealt to the enemy. Check to see if the 
total damage dealt by all players so far is equal to 
or greater than the enemy’s health. For example if 
facing a Jack and one player deals 9 damage in their 
turn, then another player deals 12 damage in their 
turn, the total damage currently dealt would be 21 
so the enemy would be defeated.

If the enemy is defeated, do the following:
(i) Place the enemy in the discard pile. If the players 
have dealt damage exactly equal to the enemy’s 
health, place it facedown on top of the Tavern deck 
instead.
(ii) Place all cards played by players against the 
enemy in the discard pile.
(iii) Turn the next card of the Castle deck face up.
(iv) The player who has just defeated the enemy 
skips Step 4 and begins a new turn against the 
enemy just revealed, starting at Step 1.

STEP FOUR
Suffer damage from the enemy by discarding cards
If not defeated, the enemy attacks the current player 
by dealing damage equal to that enemy’s attack 
value. Remember to reduce the enemy’s attack 
value by the total value of Spades that players have 
played against the enemy.

The current player must discard cards from their 
hand with a total value at least equal to the enemy’s 
attack value. Discard the cards one at a time, faceup 
to the discard pile. Animal Companions (A) have a 
value of 1 and the Jester a value of 0 when discarded 
to cover damage. If the player cannot discard 
enough cards to satisfy the damage, they die and all 
players lose the game. It’s ok to have an empty hand. 
After suffering damage, the next player in clockwise 
order begins their turn, starting at Step 1. 

ANIMAL COMPANIONS
In Step 1, Animal Companions can be played on 
their own, but may also be paired with one other 
card (except the Jester). Animal Companions count 
as 1 towards the attack total and their suit power 
is also applied. For example, when playing the 8 of 
Diamonds with the Animal Companion of Clubs the 
attack value is 9 and the effects of both suit powers 
are applied for 9: 9 cards are drawn and 18 damage 
is dealt. Any time where both a Hearts power and 
Diamonds power are resolved together, resolve 
the Hearts healing before drawing with Diamonds. 
Animal Companions can also be paired with one 
other Animal Companion. If you play an Animal 
Companion with another card of the same suit, you 
only apply the suit power once. 

COMBOS
In Step 1, instead of playing a single card, players 
can combine cards together in sets of 2, 3 or 4 of the 
same number as long as the combined total of the 
cards played equals 10 or less. Animal Companions 
cannot be added to a combo or played as a combo 
on their own; they can only ever be paired with 
one other card (which could be another Animal 
Companion). So players can play a pair of 2s, 3s, 
4s, or 5s, triple 2s and 3s, or quadruple 2s. When 
these cards are played together all suit powers are 
resolved at the total attack value. For example, if a 
player plays the 3 of Diamonds, Spades and Clubs 
together, players will draw 9 cards, reduce the 
enemy’s attack value by 9 and deal 18 damage. Any 
time where both a Hearts power and Diamonds 
power are resolved together, resolve the Hearts 
healing before drawing with Diamonds. 

ENEMY IMMUNITY
Each enemy is immune to the suit powers of 
cards played against them which match their suit. 
For example, players will not draw cards when a 
diamond is played against the Jack of Diamonds 
(however the number is still added to the damage 
total). The Jester can be played to cancel an enemy’s 
immunity.
Enemy suit power immunity
(Spades won’t block damage 
against Jack of Spades)

PLAYING THE JESTER
In Step 1 when playing a card the Jester may be 
played (always on its own).
The Jester has an attack value of 0. The power of the 
Jester is that it negates the immunity of the enemy 
meaning the suit powers of cards with the same suit 
as the enemy will now take effect when played. After 
playing the Jester, skip steps 3 and 4 then, instead 
of play moving to the next player the player of the 
Jester chooses any player to go next.
After playing the Jester the normal restrictions on 
player communication (see Communication) are 
temporarily changed. Until the next player starts 
their turn players may express their desire (or 
reluctance) to go next in a general way. For example 
you may say “I have a good play” or “I would rather 
not go next”. You still may not reveal the contents of 
your hand.

If the Jester is played against a spades enemy, 
spades played prior to the Jester will begin reducing 
the attack value of the enemy however clubs played 
prior to the Jester against a clubs enemy will not 
count for double.

DRAWING A DEFEATED ENEMY
Jacks in hand count as a 10, Queens in hand count 
as a 15 and Kings in hand count as a 20. These 
values are applied when either playing them as an 
attack card or discarding them from hand to suffer 
damage. Their suit power is applied as normal when 
played

YIELDING
During Step 1 it may be beneficial to yield instead of 
playing a card. To yield simply say “Yield” and move 
directly to Step 4 (Suffer damage from the enemy), 
skipping Steps 2 and 3. A player may not yield if 
every other player has yielded on their last turn. For 
example, in a three player game, if two players have 
yielded in a row the third player may not yield. 

COMMUNICATION
Players may not communicate to the other players 
any information which may reveal or suggest the 
contents of their hand. They may however remind 
other players of any public information such as 
how many cards they have in their hand. Some 
examples of allowed communication are: “I have 
two cards in hand” or “We only have 3 cards left in 
the Tavern deck!”. Some examples of prohibited 
communication are: “I’ve got a 10 of clubs” or “I hope 
someone plays a Diamond soon!” or “If you play a 
Heart then I can probably help us get some cards in 
hand” or “Don’t kill that enemy, leave them for me!
After a Jester is played the normal restrictions on 
player communication are temporarily changed. 
Until the next player starts their turn players may 
express their desire (or reluctance) to go next in 
a general way. For example you may say “I have a 
good play” or “I would rather not go next”. You may 
still not reveal the contents of your hand.

GAME END
The game ends when the players win by defeating 
the last King or when the players lose because a 
player is unable to satisfy the damage dealt by an 
enemy. The players also lose if any player is unable 
to play a card or yield on their turn

Here is the state of the game and some reminders.  My request to you for your decision is in Action:.

Cards can be represented as cardSUIT such that 7H represents the 7 of HEARTS.  
Conventions for names: C=CLUBS, S=SPADES, H=HEARTS, and D=DIAMONDS.  *=JOKER, J=JACK, Q=QUEEN, and K=KING

Based on these rules, I will tell you what the state of the game is in including if I made an action, an action request for you to do, your hand as a set {cardSUIT, ...}, 
what monster is in play  (cardSUIT), what are the cards battling against them as a set {cardSUIT, ...}, 
where the card in this set furthest to the right is the last card I played (noting, I might say YIELD as my action), and Cards in Discard as an integer.  

Key rules to remember:
- A key consideration is either of us can play, there is no turn order, but we are limited to what we can communicate.

The start of this game has the following:

State:
My Action was: 
Action: I would like you to play a card.
Action: Do you want to play a card or should I (noting what you can communicate)?
Your Hand: {5H, 5D, 7H, 9H, 7S, 6C, 9C}
Enemy: JC
Played: 
Cards in Discard: 0 

----

What is your play (based on this prompt, I have chosen to let you play) described as {cardSUIT, ...} noting that you can typically only play 1 card unless it's a YIELD or PET or YIELD?
Update the state to reflect the situation noting that the enemy might attack you and you will need to discard cards.  Also, suggest if I should go 
or you should go on the next turn once we know the enemy.  Also, a key consideration is either of us can play, there is no turn order, but we are limited to what we can communicate.
