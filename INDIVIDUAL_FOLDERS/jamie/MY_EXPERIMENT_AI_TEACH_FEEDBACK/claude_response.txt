I'll analyze your teaching of Faraway and provide structured feedback.

0) Initial Feedback:
Your teach focused heavily on the mechanical aspects of gameplay but skipped the thematic context and overall goal. 
While you did cover the core mechanisms, the teaching order made it challenging for players to understand the strategic implications, particularly around scoring. 
The interactive approach of starting play while teaching helped, but some key concepts like the scoring direction versus play direction remained unclear until late in the game.

1) Proposed Teaching Outline: In file...

2) Teaching Strategy Reasoning:
- Start with theme and goal to provide context for mechanical decisions
- Introduce core concepts before details to build a framework for understanding
- Show card anatomy early as it's referenced throughout the teach
- Demonstrate turn structure with an example round to reinforce concepts
- Leave detailed scoring explanation until after basic flow is understood
- End with strategic considerations to help players make informed decisions

3) Comparison to Your Teach:
Similarities:
- Interactive approach using actual gameplay
- Focus on mechanical execution
- Progressive revelation of concepts

Differences:
- Your teach skipped thematic context
- Started with hand management before core concepts
- Delayed explanation of scoring direction vs play direction
- Less emphasis on resource rarity and strategic implications
- More reactive to questions rather than structured presentation

4) Evaluation Summary:
The teach was partially successful but had some notable issues:
- Players showed confusion about scoring direction vs play direction
- Resource requirements and prerequisites weren't fully understood initially
- Sanctuary card mechanics required multiple clarifications
- Players struggled with strategic planning due to unclear scoring implications
- The game's results (tied scores) suggest players managed to grasp core concepts by game end

5) Suggested Improvements:
- Begin with theme and goal to provide context
- Explicitly state the play direction vs scoring direction early
- Use visual aids to demonstrate scoring progression
- Explain resource rarity and its strategic implications upfront
- Provide a clear example of complete round scoring before starting
- Create a quick reference guide for quest types and scoring conditions
- Consider teaching scoring system before starting actual play
- Use pre-arranged hands for first round to demonstrate key concepts

The teach succeeded in getting players through the game but could be more effective with a more structured approach 
focusing on strategic understanding rather than just mechanical execution. The frequency of clarifying questions during 
play suggests that some core concepts could have been explained more clearly upfront.

Follow up prompt:
"Assuming the game has to be experienced due to the challenging concept of scoring from right to left (which is a hard concept to understand) 
can you update your outline such that more people will understand this key idea without having to experience it."

Response: teaching-outline(1).md

Follow up two:
Can you rate how well I taught this game based on the transcript and suggest what I should do the next time I teach this.

Response: I'll analyze your teaching performance based on the transcript and provide structured feedback.

Rating: 6/10 - Functional but with significant room for improvement

Strengths demonstrated in transcript:
1. Interactive approach - You got players involved quickly
2. Patient with questions - You consistently answered player queries
3. Supportive tone - You reassured players when they made mistakes
4. Real-time corrections - You allowed players to adjust moves when they misunderstood rules

Areas that needed improvement:
1. Structure - Your teach was reactive rather than proactive, leading to scattered information delivery
2. Scoring explanation - The critical right-to-left scoring mechanism wasn't clear until late in the game
3. Theme omission - You explicitly skipped the theme ("first two pages are literally about the world and I decided to leave that out")
4. Strategic context - Players didn't understand the importance of their choices until after making them

Evidence of confusion from transcript:
1. Multiple players expressed uncertainty about scoring:
   - "I have no idea what this card does"
   - "I don't think I have like any points here"
   - "My dyslexic brain reversed all this"

2. Resource understanding issues:
   - "Does the color matter for that?"
   - "Oh, the color doesn't matter for that?"

3. Sanctuary card confusion:
   - Multiple discussions about how many cards to draw
   - Uncertainty about when they could be played

Recommendations for next teach:

1. Pre-game Setup:
- Prepare a sample 3-4 card tableau for scoring demonstration
- Have reference cards ready for resource frequency
- Keep your theme introduction very brief but don't skip it entirely

2. Structure Your Teach:
- Start with the game's goal
- Demo scoring with pre-set cards before any gameplay
- Use consistent directional language ("journey forward, score backward")
- Show a complete round with sample hands before real play begins

3. Visual Aids:
- Lay out cards in a clear line while teaching
- Use arrows or gestures to show play direction vs scoring direction
- Keep sample resource combinations visible during early rounds

4. Practice Phrases:
- "We're building our journey from left to right"
- "When we look back at our journey, we'll score right to left"
- "Earlier cards can help later cards score, but not the other way around"

5. Early Game Support:
- Narrate the first few turns' implications
- Point out scoring opportunities as they arise
- Highlight resource frequency importance early

Key Quote from Transcript:
"You will understand it the second time you play, first time it's a disaster."
While this proved true, your goal should be to minimize the "disaster" feeling of the first play.

Your teach wasn't bad - players completed the game and some even tied for the win. However, you can make it significantly clearer by implementing these changes. The key is to front-load the critical scoring concept while keeping the early rounds more guided.

This is evidenced by this player quote near the end:
"Now, I realize the beginning. So... yeah, yeah. Sometimes 16... You said 16? Yes. Well done."
Players eventually understood, but earlier comprehension would have led to more strategic play throughout.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide specific examples for the pre-set tableau demonstration?
