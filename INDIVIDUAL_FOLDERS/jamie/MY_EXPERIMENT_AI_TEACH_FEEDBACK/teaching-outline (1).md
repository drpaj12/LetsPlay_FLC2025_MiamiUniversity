# Faraway Teaching Outline

## 1. Game Overview
- Theme: Exploring a mysterious, ever-changing continent called Alula
- Goal: Score the most points by discovering resources and completing quests
- Game Length: 8 rounds of card placement

## 2. Core Concept Demo (Before Full Rules)
- Set up a sample 4-card tableau face-up
- Demonstrate scoring process using simple cards:
  * Card 1 (rightmost): "Score 2 points per blue gem"
  * Card 2: Shows two blue gems
  * Card 3: Shows one blue gem
  * Card 4 (leftmost): "Score 1 point per blue gem"
- Walk through scoring:
  1. Flip all cards face down
  2. Reveal rightmost card - explain it sees no gems yet
  3. Reveal next card - now first card sees two gems
  4. Continue process showing how later cards help earlier ones

## 3. Card Anatomy
- Card Number (1-68)
- Resource Icons (Top of Card)
- Day/Night Symbol
- Quest Requirements & Rewards
- Prerequisites for Scoring

## 4. Gameplay Flow
a) Cards are played Left-to-Right building your journey
b) Each turn:
   - Simultaneously choose & reveal cards
   - Check for Sanctuary cards (if number higher than previous)
   - Pick new cards in order of lowest number
c) After 8 rounds, score Right-to-Left revealing your discoveries

## 5. Sanctuary Cards
- Earned by playing higher numbers than your previous card
- Benefits:
  * Additional resources
  * Clues (draw more sanctuary cards)
  * Extra scoring opportunities
- Choose one from multiple drawn

## 6. Resource Types & Strategy
- Three types of resources:
  * Minerals (Blue Gems) - Most Common
  * Animals (Creatures) - Medium Rarity
  * Plants (Thistles) - Rarest
- Resources remain available for all scoring cards
- Plan resource collection based on scoring cards

## 7. Interactive Teaching Round
- Deal simple starter hands
- Play through first round highlighting:
  * Card selection thought process
  * Sanctuary card acquisition
  * Card selection order based on numbers
- Show immediate scoring example after third card

## 8. Strategic Elements
- Balance between:
  * Low numbers (earlier picks) vs High numbers (sanctuaries)
  * Immediate resources vs Future scoring potential
- Importance of card order and prerequisites
- Planning resource collection

## 9. Final Reminders
- 8 Rounds total
- Think about how future cards will help past cards score
- Remember resource frequency (Minerals > Animals > Plants)

## Teaching Tips
- Use physical cards to build example tableau
- Have players practice flipping and scoring with sample cards
- Encourage questions during demo scoring
- Remind players they're building their path forward but scoring looking backward
- Compare to reading a story - you place events in order, then reflect back on what was discovered
