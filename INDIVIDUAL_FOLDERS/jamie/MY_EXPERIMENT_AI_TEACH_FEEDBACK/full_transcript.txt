[Speaker 1]
Okay, so everybody will have a hand of three cards, and this is, so in a six player game as, as I'm demonstrating here, these will be cards that you will potentially choose on the next round, based on, who plays the lowest card this round. The goal of the game is to score the most points in each of these has some sort of condition that you're trying to score. So this one has no condition and scores. No points. This one you would get three points for every pineapple in your Tableau. Now, I have to explain how you score that Tableau because that is the most complex part, but this is roughly the gameplay. So everybody will look at their hand. They have three cards and they'll choose one to play it. Everybody secretly plays. Then we all reveal and we add it. So this is going to be going from left to right? So I'm adding it left to right? So Um, that is important because it scores right to left and I'll explain that in a second once everybody's played their cards. So this one for example, if I meet the condition of having two blue gems, so this one is a pineapple or whatever fruit. It would score eight points. And so all eight, we're going to play eight cards in each card, can score points all the way down to card one. And someone else played their card. So Mike played theirs in their case. He played a lower number. So on his turn, he will pick first from this. And then by chance I will go second and so on and that will replenish your hand. The other thing to notice is these cards. So when you play ascending, so I played a 14, previous and now 21, I get one of these. I could get more of these. Because these cards say you draw. And you keep one. So you get, you can do these and these are just special abilities. Um for example this one is a red. It's it's a red card. So certain scoring mechanisms will score for every red land in your Tableau. This one, uh, basically says, this one is a score for green or I believe it's an ore green or blue. You'll get one point. So at the end of the game, if I had this This, this would score one two points. Okay. So there's there's different things that are scoring different things that are not eventually at the end of the game. And I don't know if this will be a good example. So we've all placed our eighth card. This is how we score, so we flip them all. And this just helps you to score properly. And you score it in this direction. So I flip over this card. There's no pineapples currently up. So this one would score zero points. Okay, then I flip this one. I've done very poorly in this one because I didn't plan it out but I do not meet that condition. Nothing has that and say these are in my my Tableau sometimes these will have these symbols uh, that symbol that I need. So I need that blue symbol. If by chance my card's up here, had that blue sample? I would score that and that scores for some condition, and then we keep on flipping. And so the scorecard literally is one through eight. And that's how we we just go. Okay. Eight. What'd you get for this and whoever scor

Now, your questions.

[Speaker 2]
Can you show us the anatomy of a card? What we can expect on cards and

[Speaker 1]
Uh read them? Yes. So um, well, there's the number right and the their number from one two.

[Speaker 2]
So

[Speaker 1]
One is the lowest and typically the lower numbers have less scoring conditions because they give you uh the grabbing ability. So, I believe it's one to 68. So I'm going from low to high, and if I break that, I draw a card. No, every time you go from lower to higher, you will draw one of these cards. So in this case, I wouldn't get a card but I could start again. Again, I failed Where I did succeed. So I would get one of them so you can be incrementing.

[Speaker 2]
All the way

[Speaker 1]
You could, in theory, get seven of them. So

[Speaker 3]
Does that act as a Tailwind or

[Speaker 1]
A boon or is it in between? It's just a challenge. It's yeah. That's a good question. But I I don't have an answer. That's like a strategy question. Okay.

[Speaker 4]
It's this number. Not that number correct. This is

[Speaker 1]
Your condition of scoring. This is the numbering. There's icons across the top. For example, there are three different Goods. There's the animal good, there's the blue good. And there's the plant good These are the conditions for that

[Speaker 4]
Ring difference,

[Speaker 1]
Night and day. Yeah, so it's when you explore it. So some things will Interact with Knights, some things will interact with day.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, okay

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
So for every night card that you have in your Tableau that's on that side that's the hard part, right? So you're bringing these out and you want to get the conditions to happen such that when that flips over in the scoring it activates, that's the challenge in this game. And

[Speaker 3]
So we all play one card and end up with one from the market.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. You're taking it from the market is in what sequence? So, it's play a card. Yeah. Then resolve this if you get one. So you might get a few cards everybody. Then in order picks. So the lowest number picks first of the card played that round. Yes. Yes, picks first. And then plays the card out that they've chosen to keep because you

[Speaker 3]
Only

[Speaker 1]
Get to keep one of them. Does it immediately refill after they pass it? No. Okay. There are only six available to pick from.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
And this is played when you get it. So when I have this high so say I just got

[Speaker 3]
I would draw three cards.

[Speaker 2]
I

[Speaker 1]
Would decide which one I'm going to keep.

[Speaker 4]
I got it, those

[Speaker 1]
Go away. And then when I do my picking, I also reveal this. So any maps that you've dropped previously,

[Speaker 4]
Plus, whatever your the condition is. Okay. Yeah. And you play left to right, you score right to left.

[Speaker 1]
Yes. And I

[Speaker 2]
Recommend

[Speaker 1]
Trying to make a line, although we might not have a table space, so you might just flip down low and then we'll score that way backwards. Try it. And then see if we understand,

[Speaker 3]
What is the what's the narrative here? Like like what are these cards?

[Speaker 5]
No, it seems to me. It's telling a story.

[Speaker 1]
It is we are. Yeah, we are exactly doing that. But I I that

[Speaker 4]
But they bothered to draw all those pictures. Well, not

[Speaker 1]
Only that first two pages are literally about the the world and I decided to leave that out.

[Speaker 4]
Because it really has nothing to do. Well,

[Speaker 1]
The card game. Exactly, it's the classic. Uh, so

[Speaker 4]
It's love flavor.

[Speaker 2]
Do you know the frequency of the I do not symbols.

[Speaker 1]
I do not. Okay, I do.

[Speaker 2]
The pineapples are the least frequent thing to pop up. The animal heads are the second least frequent and the blue gem. Things are the most frequent, okay? Which might help you make choices.

[Speaker 3]
Again, that strategy. See if you can play the game.

[Speaker 1]
Okay.

So, these will be the available pile. You will have to play one card. And it's there is no getting of these special resources on your first play because it is not greater then. So you might want to start low. You might not have the possibility.

[Speaker 2]
So, let's play that.

I flip

[Speaker 1]
Over. Hey, who's low? You get to pick first from this set. Jeopard card, you was like, 17 is next right?

[Speaker 4]
Oh I misread that.

[Speaker 2]
Oh it goes into your hand. It

[Speaker 1]
Goes into. Your house

[Speaker 4]
Goes into my hand. Okay. The wrong.

[Speaker 6]
You can switch if you want to change because I I read the wrong. I read the wrong number.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah

[Speaker 3]
I read the wrong number I'd replicate this one.

[Speaker 1]
17th next. Yep. 17 then 26.

I think I'm going to do this one.

[Speaker 2]
Thank you.

[Speaker 1]
So this counts as two pineapples. No. Yeah it needs that to activate it, it's

[Speaker 2]
One blue gem but this is its precondition in order to score this. Okay?

[Speaker 3]
Got it.

[Speaker 2]
Karen.

[Speaker 3]
So if it reveals I do not have two pineapples.

[Speaker 1]
It's board zero. Okay. Is its icon. So it still will have these effects but it won't score.

[Speaker 3]
All

[Speaker 1]
Right, here's the next set coming out. Okay, so now if you are ascending ascending is the word, um, You will get one of these but you don't have to

[Speaker 2]
Okay. 27,

[Speaker 4]
19. 23 55. Okay. Who

[Speaker 1]
Did increase

[Speaker 2]
13. I did.

[Speaker 4]
I did

[Speaker 1]
You all get one? I think everybody gets

[Speaker 2]
Two. And you keep one. Is it two? Keep

[Speaker 1]
One. Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Sorry it's always keep one, but the number. But the maps

[Speaker 1]
Increase. Yeah, no. And I don't get anything and I didn't either. Oh. So that would increase the number. Yes. So

[Speaker 3]
Then you get three three, you get to keep one.

All right, no clue what I'm doing. But the effect of these it's immediate or

[Speaker 1]
Forever for

[Speaker 2]
Score last. After you score your Tableau, then you score any scoring conditions on them, but they contribute all the time they're always on. So,

[Speaker 4]
Does this mean because I got these two up here, does that mean that I got two off of this card? No, because we will score in the other direction. Have to be to the other side. Yes, yes. Okay, I got you,

[Speaker 1]
But always. Yeah. Okay. But you might end

[Speaker 2]
Up with one of these little sanctuary cards necessarily.

[Speaker 3]
This is right?

[Speaker 1]
You reveal it when you pick your card. Um not that that matters so night 13 I believe is still

[Speaker 4]
Your low. Yes.

[Speaker 2]
I can you

[Speaker 4]
Know what? I'm gonna mess this up now. You can't mess up.

[Speaker 1]
You can't. As long as you play cards, how many turns

[Speaker 4]
Are we

[Speaker 1]
Eight? Okay. Well, I think that's me. I believe I'm next right. Uh, what was my? My great dreams and hopes here.

That's for a full set of four, right? Yeah,

[Speaker 2]
Seems good. Am

[Speaker 1]
I gonna have Force? Yeah, I'll take it.

[Speaker 2]
You bring it out, end it up here. If you ever get some Sanctuary cards,

[Speaker 1]
Double pulled on.

[Speaker 4]
What number are you?

[Speaker 3]
Sorry, I was just two. I was just following the table.

[Speaker 2]
You're 20

[Speaker 1]
23, I believe and I'm 27. So I'm at 23. Then, Karen

[Speaker 4]
Me,

[Speaker 1]
Your last, you will get the, you get an easy decision. And that is

[Speaker 2]
Preconditions. It's just a yellow card. It gives you a map and a pineapple.

[Speaker 4]
Minnesota option for that one. That's what I was thinking.

Also, Mike played that tried to get that card so I thought it was good.

[Speaker 1]
Giving you suggestions.

Okay. Oh we have the one you clip your cards over

[Speaker 4]
Here

[Speaker 3]
And yes.

[Speaker 4]
What that means. So it gives you a blue crystals. These are scored at the end. Yeah.

So right now you have three points.

[Speaker 1]
Hmm.

Let's see what's out

[Speaker 4]
There. Do I really want to

[Speaker 1]
Go for? They're all low numbers other than the 50?

Every good. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
I'm less than 67.

[Speaker 1]
1364.

[Speaker 2]
I jumped in front or you jumped in front of me.

[Speaker 3]
Why do I get four?

[Speaker 1]
One, two, three, boys.

[Speaker 7]
I get yeah, no three Sanctuary cards. Three, keep one incremented I

[Speaker 4]
Went down, but I don't know. She gets uh, to three. She gets a chorito three. You get one if you have this or is it?

[Speaker 1]
No, that's when you get it, you'll get an additional one to look through.

All right, you can flip those in. I don't think they really matter that much. All right, low. Number 12, 16. 12 is the winner.

Or the loser.

And

[Speaker 2]
Wanted that pineapple I

[Speaker 4]
Did. I

[Speaker 2]
Want a pineapple too?

[Speaker 4]
Does that mean now 28?

[Speaker 1]
Yep. 28 is next, then 42.

[Speaker 2]
And then 64.67.

[Speaker 8]
So

[Speaker 2]
There's not gonna be anything good left.

I like all of those,

[Speaker 4]
I don't know. This is still around. I might as well take it.

[Speaker 2]
Do you put out one more than the number of people? Because it seems like on the the last person would have two to choose from not just

[Speaker 1]
We might be, but we'll

[Speaker 2]
Just play it that way for since we started it that way.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. I believe you read it. I imagined we were playing five player. So, there's always one, there's no. Yeah, you have a choice. You're not always forced. Uh, real, as many cards from the deck as there are players. Plus one,

[Speaker 2]
I didn't notice till I was last, and I didn't have any choice.

[Speaker 3]
Now, we'll do it that way. Game totally changes. So I know you

[Speaker 1]
Just had a strategy, but

I gotta hope I get lucky.

[Speaker 2]
They're

[Speaker 1]
Pretty good. Yeah. Hey, who's

[Speaker 4]
32 41. No, I did go up

[Speaker 1]
Three.

[Speaker 3]
So if I don't get it, none of the bonus draws

[Speaker 1]
Happen. Exactly. If I draw any

[Speaker 4]
You have to trigger it in order to get the bonus.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, correct. You did it? I did not. 52 looks bigger than 16.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah you do.

[Speaker 1]
I'm I never sorry.

[Speaker 3]
No, I'm like

[Speaker 1]
I see that. You get one but I don't see it. You keep on going like this. I was pretty sure I wasn't

[Speaker 3]
Gonna get that. Like I wasn't, I don't think I was planning on playing now, which is fine.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, what's the order here?

[Speaker 4]
I'm 11.

[Speaker 1]
111. 36

[Speaker 2]
41,

[Speaker 1]
41, 45 52.

[Speaker 4]
I think I should be last. You are

[Speaker 1]
There's no duplicates on the numbers. Nope.

Good choice. I don't even know what I want to take here.

[Speaker 2]
Is just

[Speaker 4]
The color of the card.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, to the to the yeah. Yeah.

The activation will be the hardest part, just keep that in mind. So like I have a three red. I'm like

[Speaker 2]
I need

[Speaker 1]
Those three Reds. If this is ever gonna happen

[Speaker 2]
I only get four more cards,

[Speaker 1]
You'll see it, once we score.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah the score once you see the score happen, the first time you're like uh

[Speaker 1]
Oh the hardest thing. That's yeah

[Speaker 4]
It is. It's it's it's to my I play about BGA. The cards has helped so helpful, like as usually did I'm like, oh, Could do that. Like physically, just not see the other parts. Just show me the values, don't show me how to activate them.

[Speaker 2]
11. So, who's up next?

[Speaker 1]
Uh, I'm

[Speaker 4]
Waiting

[Speaker 1]
To

[Speaker 4]
See all the two cards out there. So all these are in Canada.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, it's your future. You have to imagine your future to activate them.

[Speaker 3]
Just part of the story, we didn't read is that you're a Seer. Say what's gonna happen to me?

[Speaker 1]
Yes, I'll take the 21

[Speaker 2]
21.

[Speaker 1]
I'll take. Hmm, don't like either. Uh, 49 doesn't seem insane, it's kind of insane.

I'll

[Speaker 3]
Do this. Okay. Next round.

[Speaker 2]
I'm never gonna get a sanctuary card.

[Speaker 4]
No, I'm the same. I'm like, this is never gonna happen.

[Speaker 2]
Wow.

Sensible one, right?

Oh sorry, it's okay. 49.

[Speaker 4]
I'm not two, three, four, five, six,

[Speaker 3]
Jeez. Nice.

[Speaker 1]
Of Oregon's. Plus

[Speaker 3]
I don't got it.

[Speaker 4]
I got one too

[Speaker 1]
Plus and I went up. So does that mean

[Speaker 4]
Yeah it means four total. Yeah, no no

[Speaker 1]
No no,

[Speaker 2]
No. I did

[Speaker 1]
So.

[Speaker 4]
I'm actually playing so I don't get them

[Speaker 1]
Any strategy

[Speaker 4]
But I'm at eight so I played low. So I go first with pulling these

[Speaker 1]
Uh yep.

[Speaker 4]
That's what I want.

[Speaker 2]
I'm 21 is anybody lower than 21? We'll take the yellow one with a pineapple.

[Speaker 4]
Roger zero.

[Speaker 2]
It's

[Speaker 4]
Me, right? No no. I mean I'm next

I'm happy with any of them. That's the good news.

[Speaker 5]
It's

[Speaker 2]
Got the guaranteed

[Speaker 1]
Points. Pineapples, guaranteed Five Points. So good. Pineapple

[Speaker 2]
Very

[Speaker 1]
Good. Yep.

[Speaker 2]
56.

[Speaker 1]
We're getting

[Speaker 7]
Snow. Yes, one, two, three, four,

[Speaker 4]
Yes, one, two, three, four, three.

[Speaker 3]
I

[Speaker 2]
Get three.

[Speaker 3]
No again, no again.

[Speaker 4]
No, I'm telling you like, that's the skill.

[Speaker 2]
Damn it.

[Speaker 3]
I'm setting up for something different, this time. Like I understand the value of the sanctuary cards, but it's like, You're trying to actually say your scoring semi scoring. Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 1]
We'll we'll see it. Yeah,

[Speaker 4]
Um, okay, so anybody lower than four, I got 47. So

[Speaker 2]
So I gotta play two

[Speaker 4]
More cards. I really want to stop people from getting. That's the

[Speaker 2]
Question.

Uh, who's

[Speaker 1]
Next?

[Speaker 2]
I'm 56. I'm probably not next

[Speaker 1]
14. I believe, right?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. 47.

[Speaker 1]
14 is next, okay?

[Speaker 2]
That's just two wrong

[Speaker 1]
Points.

[Speaker 2]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Yep.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. And this

[Speaker 1]
One is every set of four. That's before it

[Speaker 2]
And it also counts these up here. So you

[Speaker 3]
Have one green.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
And does it count itself? Yes. Did the green green? Yeah.

Uh, who's next 31? 47. Where do I want? Theory. This one, I guess I'm not in love with it.

Anybody

[Speaker 4]
Lower than 47? Nope.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, this one. I'm 56.

[Speaker 4]
You're next because I'm 63.

[Speaker 2]
Oh okay. Well, I will take some antlers.

[Speaker 4]
It's about 60.

Yeah. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
The last

[Speaker 3]
Drama, there won't be cards. So

[Speaker 1]
I have to

[Speaker 2]
Do this.

Ready. Six.

[Speaker 4]
Five, 32 24,

[Speaker 1]
23. Hey not increasy,

[Speaker 4]
Not increasing. No

[Speaker 1]
I did three finally.

[Speaker 2]
No,

[Speaker 1]
Not I did, but

[Speaker 2]
I don't think I have like any points here. I

[Speaker 5]
Don't either. My dyslexic brain reversed, all this, and it's like, no,

[Speaker 4]
Because it's gonna kind of go this way.

[Speaker 1]
That's the lowest number, right,

[Speaker 3]
24 for me.

[Speaker 2]
So, I'm gonna do that.

[Speaker 5]
Anything out there. Gotta change my mind for my last card.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Okay. Oh

[Speaker 2]
I'm six. It must be me.

[Speaker 8]
Um

[Speaker 2]
Shoot, I thought I knew what I was gonna play. I guess I will take this. And start doing computations in my head.

[Speaker 4]
Was this the last hand? This is the last one. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
What's your number 20? You're next.

[Speaker 4]
I think.

I get

[Speaker 1]
From this garbage but in theory I don't play either of those so really doesn't matter. We get sanctuaries on this last one.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, yep.

[Speaker 1]
If you do it right.

[Speaker 2]
Really dark.

[Speaker 1]
All right, Kurt Oh sorry. 48. Hey, who gets 68. I'm drawing

[Speaker 2]
To an inside Street. Given Sanctuary card.

[Speaker 1]
You get six? How many did you get?

[Speaker 4]
I think I get One, two, three, four, four, five, six, five,

[Speaker 1]
Six. Yes, because you get

[Speaker 4]
Two automatically. That one doesn't count.

[Speaker 3]
Oh three, four. That one does. But

[Speaker 2]
That one doesn't

[Speaker 3]
So you got four,

[Speaker 1]
Four?

[Speaker 4]
I need four.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, three three.

[Speaker 2]
Five, thank you five.

[Speaker 5]
Yes, this is exactly what I needed,

[Speaker 3]
Trade anyone? Yes, that one's so bad. Actually,

[Speaker 1]
Two points.

[Speaker 4]
Yep.

[Speaker 3]
Everything's dead. Then we all

[Speaker 1]
Flip it over and we'll do it round by round. Just to see how it scores. Everybody can.

[Speaker 2]
Shoot. Well, you know, drawn to an inside

[Speaker 1]
Straight, they will be scored at the very end

[Speaker 4]
Their attributes.

[Speaker 1]
Yep. Their attributes are always available, okay? Okay, so everybody flip their last card. So Mike, do you score it? Yes. Five Do you score it? No. Because you've got one. Yeah. Yeah but it does not score. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Oh I'll eventually but but no no no. This is the moment. This is this is what we're talking about at this moment.

[Speaker 1]
That's what we're

[Speaker 3]
That's

[Speaker 1]
Why we flip it back in the opposite way. And that's the hard part to understand and you

[Speaker 3]
Play One Direction and then you score

[Speaker 1]
You will understand it. The second time you play first time it's a disaster.

[Speaker 2]
Yes,

[Speaker 3]
It is right.

I get three points. Three points. Well done, Karen

[Speaker 2]
Zero

[Speaker 1]
And I also get zero. All right next card.

[Speaker 2]
All right, does it score? I might not score any points

[Speaker 3]
On these

[Speaker 2]
Guys but I didn't. That was

[Speaker 3]
The rough part for me, too. It was like I do have that, I did

[Speaker 5]
One of those.

[Speaker 3]
I desperately needed the second one available to satisfy that and then for every night

[Speaker 1]
And this is a night. So you actually score two four points.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, I see because I got this and that so well

[Speaker 1]
You have this and this which is two times two, okay, okay. All right,

[Speaker 4]
I think I do zero. Yeah, no, no horns. Um, I've

[Speaker 3]
Got seven,

[Speaker 1]
Seven, Karen zero, Score because I have the pineapple and the pineapple. So I get four points for red. So eight points. In theory. Yeah, if

[Speaker 3]
You do it right.

[Speaker 9]
Oh, now I see, I just played these on the wrong order.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, I got it. This I'm only is that night? No, no Rings. I don't have anything for that.

[Speaker 1]
So zero. Did you get yours? You have one. I don't have. You have two horns and you have the pineapples, so you do. So you get 15.

[Speaker 4]
Okay. Do you see that horn horn? Pineapple, but it's not green. Oh,

[Speaker 3]
The color doesn't matter for that? No, just the resource. Oh,

[Speaker 9]
Okay. All right. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Red and yellow. So, one, two, three, four. I got four. Hey, next one. Is

[Speaker 3]
That red or yellow?

[Speaker 2]
Dang.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Either one scores one.

[Speaker 10]
This is gonna be.

[Speaker 3]
Oh I thought you had to okay. You don't have

[Speaker 10]
To choose. I thought it was. Yeah, that's that's on me. One two. Is that it?

[Speaker 2]
Man, I really need.

[Speaker 3]
Oh yeah. Like that. I played this score. See, I played this zero card and I got two resources. It's also a daytime card. Yeah. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
It's hard. It's hard.

[Speaker 3]
Like, I

[Speaker 1]
Mean, might some of them. Um, I get 12.

[Speaker 3]
12.

[Speaker 1]
Zero.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah I'm hoping to

The one, two, three horns. So I scored 13. Hey, next one.

[Speaker 2]
Wow, don't get this one either. Dang.

[Speaker 4]
I have no idea what this card does.

[Speaker 3]
A map gave you daytime and it gave you. I got that right. It has no conditions or anything but it has no condition.

[Speaker 1]
It helps every horn, you'll get three points. So

[Speaker 6]
That's one. Yep,

[Speaker 4]

[Speaker 1]
Hey, Mike.

[Speaker 9]
One, two, three, four, five,

[Speaker 1]
How are you? 12? All done.

[Speaker 3]
Times.

[Speaker 1]
Two is four. Yes, you are. Correct. Yeah.

[Speaker 9]
Uh, are you sure? No.

[Speaker 1]
I don't have

[Speaker 4]
A,

[Speaker 1]
This red yellow green blue. So you have one set of fours. Oh wait, you do have ten.

[Speaker 4]
So your last card that you play and and you have

[Speaker 1]
Another red, doesn't have another green

[Speaker 3]
Ten. I got ten. So this card's got a score here,

[Speaker 1]
Nine

[Speaker 2]
And then four and five

[Speaker 1]
Five. I get two points for every pound one.

[Speaker 3]
Oh,

[Speaker 1]
Two.

[Speaker 3]
Nobody, yeah. Hey, last one.

[Speaker 2]
To get this one. So that's, oh,

[Speaker 1]
Sorry.

[Speaker 2]
I

[Speaker 1]
Got six, ten,

[Speaker 4]
I had no idea. Six points. Cause all it was just that.

[Speaker 3]
Now, I realize the beginning. So

[Speaker 1]
It's yeah, yeah. 16. But it sets up that you get these with that. Yeah, sometimes 16

[Speaker 4]
You

[Speaker 1]
Said 16? Yes. Well done.

[Speaker 2]
12

[Speaker 1]
12. There's the big scores. Three points per pineapple. One two, three nine. Okay, now you're gonna score these cards. Yeah. You can do them on your own if you need help. I So I get for every pineapple. I get a point that's all, I'm getting. Yes, right? To

[Speaker 2]
Account every pineapple in the upper right? Would you say Mike 10 that one? Wait,

[Speaker 5]
What? For a pineapple, one, two, two. So, so two points. Yes. Five. Yeah, I mean oh you're still counting trying to do, what is that? Requirement to get its points,

[Speaker 4]
What you need to pay for it. And then for every map I get three points. Okay. Gotcha. So if you

[Speaker 1]
Play that early, you can set it up.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, well, I just like I didn't understand how that's why the numbers

[Speaker 5]
Sequence the way they do. So like that is really high value

[Speaker 1]
Because you

[Speaker 2]
Want to play it early for one

[Speaker 1]
Of them we played early,

[Speaker 4]
Then you don't get these cards. Yeah, that's a trade-off. That's what I meant when I was asking if these were a Tailwinder or not, I I

Inefficiently get those is better. I think. Yeah. Like you still kind of want to get 15 14.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 7]
Every time. No because because then you're then your complete setup is set up backwards.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Uh,

[Speaker 2]
Mike did you get

[Speaker 1]
Nine? I got nine last

[Speaker 4]
Nine points on the last one, two. Two people know how to play poker.

A bit more understanding. Yeah, it does take one game. 36.

Uh,

[Speaker 1]
Last total 12 25 29. 39 39 plus 15. Oh I snuck it out, 64. Ice myself and Mike and Mike. The ninja Drew you two tide, all right.

Wow. Hey, I might have made errors in the math, so, Take that with a grain of salt. Well that was uh I will say that was like I

[Speaker 3]
Scored terribly the first time I played this I mean like just outrageously.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah and then I

[Speaker 3]
Realized like after looking at it and reading as long as she's about playing this it's like
