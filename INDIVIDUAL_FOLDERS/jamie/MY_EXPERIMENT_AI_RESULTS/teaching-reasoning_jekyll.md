# Teaching Reasoning Document

## Begin with Theme and Goals
**Reasoning**: Starting with theme creates immediate investment and gives context for the mechanics that follow. The victory condition (landing exactly on final space) is critical to understand from the beginning.

## Focus on Core Trick-Taking with Color Ranking
**Reasoning**: The color ranking system is the game's most unique and potentially confusing mechanic. It needs clear explanation with visual demonstration before play begins. Using the physical tokens helps players visualize how this works.

## Separate Basic Rules from Special Effects
**Reasoning**: Introduce the fundamental trick-taking rules before explaining special effects like potions. This prevents cognitive overload and builds understanding in layers.

## Use Visual Demonstration
**Reasoning**: Physically showing the board, pawns movement, and especially how color ranking works creates better understanding than verbal explanation alone.

## Explain End of Round Movement Clearly
**Reasoning**: The movement mechanism (fewest tricks moves that many spaces) is counter-intuitive to experienced trick-takers who usually try to win tricks. This needs emphasis.

## Introduce Reactions with Examples
**Reasoning**: The reaction system is complex. Showing an example of each reaction helps players understand when and how they trigger.

## Save Chapter-Specific Rules for Last
**Reasoning**: Once players understand the core system, chapter-specific rules (like 8s moving an extra space) become easier to grasp.

## Begin with Chapter 1
**Reasoning**: The first chapter serves as a tutorial with fewer mechanics to track, making it easier for new players to learn the game's flow.
