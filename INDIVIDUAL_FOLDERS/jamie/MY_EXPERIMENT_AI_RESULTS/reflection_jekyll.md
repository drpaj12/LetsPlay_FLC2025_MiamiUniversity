# Problem-Solving Process Improvements

For future game teaching:

1. **Create a Structured Teaching Outline**: Organize concepts in a logical progression rather than following the rulebook directly

2. **Use Visual Demonstrations**: Show concrete examples of trick-taking, color ranking, and reactions with actual cards

3. **Confirm Understanding**: Pause after explaining key concepts to check if players have questions

4. **Use "I'll show you" Approach**: Demonstrate a sample trick to show how color ranking works

5. **Establish Communication Rules Clearly**: Explain what players can and cannot discuss upfront

6. **Simplify Initial Explanation**: Focus on core mechanics for first game, adding nuances as they become relevant

7. **Provide Strategy Hints**: Offer basic strategic considerations to help new players
