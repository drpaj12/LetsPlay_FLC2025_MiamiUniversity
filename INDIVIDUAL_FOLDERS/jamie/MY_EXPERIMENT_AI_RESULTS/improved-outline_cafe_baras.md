# Improved Cafe Baras Teaching Outline

## 1. Theme and Goal (30 seconds)
- "In Cafe Baras, we're building cozy cafes to attract capybara customers"
- "Your goal is to create the best cafe with the right foods and decor to make customers happy"
- "The player with the most points at the end wins"
- "The game ends when someone gets their third regular customer"

## 2. Card Anatomy & Dual-Purpose Concept (2 minutes)
- Show a cafe card and explain the dual-purpose nature FIRST:
  - Top part = something to add to your cafe
  - Bottom part = a customer to serve
- *Emphasize: "Each card is used for ONE purpose only - either add to your cafe OR serve the customer"*
- Demonstrate food types, decor types, and explain what customer preferences mean

## 3. Game Flow & Basic Turn Structure (1 minute)
- Explain the 3-step turn flow:
  1. Choose ONE card from hand to either ADD to cafe OR SERVE customer
  2. Follow any actions triggered by the card
  3. Refill your hand and the display

## 4. Setup (2 minutes)
- Demonstrate as you explain:
  - Shuffle cafe cards, display 4 face-up
  - Deal special guest cards (players + 1)
  - Each player gets 7 coins, 4 cards, and a counter card
  - Create coin supply

## 5. Three Core Actions with Practical Examples (5 minutes)
- **Adding a Card to Your Cafe:**
  - Pay the cost shown
  - Place in your cafe row
  - Follow any action text
  - Show a concrete example: "If I add this Cookie card, I pay 3 coins and can now satisfy customers who want sweets"
  - Explain how to organize food items vs. decor items in your cafe layout
  
- **Serving a Customer:**
  - Match foods in your cafe to what the customer wants
  - Gain 1 coin per matching food type
  - *KEY CLARIFICATION*: "If a customer wants two coffees, you need two coffee symbols in your cafe"
  - Emphasize that decor doesn't earn coins when serving a customer
  
- **Gaining a Regular:**
  - Explain the requirements clearly: "If you can provide ALL foods a customer wants AND have at least one of their preferred decor, they become a regular"
  - Demonstrate the tucking under the counter card
  - Emphasize the 4 point value per regular
  - Clearly distinguish between just serving a customer (for coins) and gaining a regular (for end-game points)

## 6. Special Guests and Game End (2 minutes)
- Explain that special guests can be claimed any time during your turn if requirements are met
- Game ends when someone gets 3 regulars (4 in 2-player) or claims the last special guest
- Everyone else gets one more turn

## 7. Scoring Overview (1 minute)
- Score cafe cards (variable points)
- Regulars (4 points each)
- Special guests (6 points each) 
- Coins (1 point per 2 coins)

## 8. Example Round (3 minutes)
- Walk through a sample turn or two
- Include examples of:
  - Adding a card to cafe
  - Serving a customer
  - Gaining a regular
  - Claiming a special guest

## 9. Key Clarifications & Reminders (1 minute)
- Customers without preferred decor can never become regulars
- You might need to serve a customer for 0 coins sometimes
- If a customer wants multiple of the same food, you need that many in your cafe
- Decor doesn't earn coins when serving, only foods do
- Explain the scoring mechanics clearly - card points, regulars (4 points each), special guests (6 points each), and points for remaining coins
- Mention any special scoring conditions on cards (points per tea variety, etc.)

## 10. Begin Play & Coach During First Round
- Guide players through their first turns
- Answer questions as they arise
- Let them know you're available for rule clarifications
