# Final Evaluation

Your teaching of Jekyll & Hyde was functional but had room for improvement in organization and clarity. The teaching eventually succeeded, as evidenced by your successful gameplay in Chapter 2, but required learning through play rather than understanding all mechanics beforehand.

The main issues observed in the transcript were:
- Confusion about turn order (who plays after whom)
- Uncertainty about how potions interact with color cards
- Lack of clarity about why and when the color ranking matters
- Some confusion about the game's objective (exact landing requirement)

Your partner seemed to grasp the game through play rather than through the initial explanation, asking clarifying questions throughout the first round. By Chapter 2, they showed better understanding of the strategic elements.

Key misunderstandings observed:
- "I'm currently winning this. Sure, a great deal." - Indicates confusion about trick-winning mechanics
- "Does that mean now white is the there's none? It's..." - Shows uncertainty about color ranking
- "I don't know how much I can tell you" - Uncertainty about communication rules
