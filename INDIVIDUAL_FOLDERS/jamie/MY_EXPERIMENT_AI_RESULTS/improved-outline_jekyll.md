# JEKYLL & HYDE VS SCOTLAND YARD - TEACHING OUTLINE

## Introduction (1-2 minutes)
- **Theme**: Jekyll and Hyde are the same person trying to maintain balance while evading Scotland Yard
- **Game Type**: Cooperative trick-taking game for 2 players
- **Victory Condition**: Get Jekyll & Hyde to land EXACTLY on the final space after 2 rounds

## Core Components (2-3 minutes)

- **Cards**: Three color suits (Blue/Fear, White/Manipulation, Red/Ruse) + Potion cards
- **Special Icons**: 8s have Jekyll & Hyde icon, 1-3s have Scotland Yard icon

## Basic Gameplay Structure (1-2 minutes)
- Each chapter played over 2 rounds
- Each round has 3 phases: Day, Night, End of Round
- Chapter 1 introduces core mechanics, later chapters add complexity

## Trick-Taking Core (3-4 minutes)
- **COLOR RANKING SYSTEM** (KEY CONCEPT): 
  - First color played gets lowest rank
  - Second color played gets middle rank
  - Third color played gets highest rank
  - Highest card of highest-ranked color wins the trick
- Must follow suit when possible
- Winner of trick leads next trick
- City (non-player) plays from its own deck of cards

## Round Structure (3-4 minutes)
1. **Day Phase**:
   - Free discussion before dealing
   - Deal 12 cards to each player
   - Each player contributes 4 cards to City deck (MUST include all 8s)
   - No communication after cards are dealt

2. **Night Phase**:
   - Play tricks until all cards are played
   - City reveals top card of its deck each turn
   - Trick winner leads next trick

3. **End of Round**:
   - Player with FEWEST tricks moves Jekyll & Hyde that many spaces
   - If Jekyll & Hyde would move beyond final space, you lose immediately
   - In Chapter 1, each 8 you win moves Jekyll & Hyde an additional space

## Reactions/Potions (2-3 minutes)
- Potion + Color card played consecutively triggers a reaction
- Reaction effect depends on the color card:
  - Red (Ruse): Take City's last trick
  - Blue (Fear): Rearrange color ranking tokens
  - White (Manipulation): Exchange card with City deck

## Begin Chapter 1 Play
- Set up board with Jekyll & Hyde at position 4
- Goal is to reach position 9 after two rounds
- Reminder: Communication only during Day phase and when resolving reactions
