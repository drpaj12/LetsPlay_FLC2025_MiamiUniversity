# Comparison of Outline to Your Teaching

## Similarities
- Both began with the basic objective of moving Jekyll & Hyde to the final position
- Both emphasized the importance of landing exactly on the final space
- Both used Chapter 1 as a learning vehicle
- Both covered the core rule of fewest tricks determining movement

## Differences
- **Structure**: Your teaching jumped between concepts (mentioning potions before explaining trick-taking basics), while my outline builds concepts systematically
- **Color Ranking Explanation**: Your explanation of the color ranking system was scattered throughout the teaching, whereas my outline emphasizes this as a core concept that needs clear explanation upfront
- **Visual Demonstration**: You referenced components but could have used them more effectively to demonstrate concepts
- **Communication Rules**: You didn't clearly establish communication limitations at the beginning
- **Reactions Explanation**: Your explanation of reaction effects was somewhat unclear, with clarifications needed during play

## Key Omissions in Your Teaching
- Didn't clearly explain how color ranking establishes which cards win tricks before beginning play
- The specific effects of potion reactions weren't fully explained until they occurred in gameplay
- Turn order was slightly confusing in your explanation
